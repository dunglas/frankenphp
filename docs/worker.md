# Using FrankenPHP workers

Boot your application once and keep it in memory.
FrankenPHP will handle incoming requests in a few milliseconds.

## Starting FrankenPHP worker scripts

### Running a FrankenPHP worker with Docker

Set the value of the `FRANKENPHP_CONFIG` environment variable to `worker /path/to/your/worker/script.php`:

```bash
docker run \
    -e FRANKENPHP_CONFIG="worker /app/path/to/your/worker/script.php" \
    -v $PWD:/app \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp \
    dunglas/frankenphp
```

### Running a FrankenPHP worker with the standalone binary

Use the `--worker` option of the `php-server` command to serve the content of the current directory using a worker:

```bash
frankenphp php-server --worker /path/to/your/worker/script.php
```

If your PHP app is [embedded in the binary](embed.md), you can add a custom `Caddyfile` in the root directory of the app.
It will be used automatically.

It's also possible to [restart the worker on file changes](config.md#watching-for-file-changes) with the `--watch` option.
The following command will trigger a restart if any file ending in `.php` in the `/path/to/your/app/` directory or subdirectories is modified:

```bash
frankenphp php-server --worker /path/to/your/worker/script.php --watch="/path/to/your/app/**/*.php"
```

This feature is often used in combination with [hot reloading](hot-reload.md).

## Worker mode for Symfony

See [the FrankenPHP Symfony worker mode documentation](symfony.md#symfony-worker-mode-with-frankenphp).

## Worker mode for Laravel Octane

See [the FrankenPHP Laravel Octane documentation](laravel.md#laravel-octane).

## Writing a custom FrankenPHP worker script

The following example shows how to create your own worker script without relying on a third-party library:

```php
<?php
// public/index.php

// Boot your app
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$myApp = new \App\Kernel();
$myApp->boot();

// Handler outside the loop for better performance (doing less work)
$handler = static function () use ($myApp) {
    try {
        // Called when a request is received,
        // superglobals, php://input and the like are reset
        echo $myApp->handle($_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, $_FILES, $_SERVER);
    } catch (\Throwable $exception) {
        // `set_exception_handler` is called only when the worker script ends,
        // which may not be what you expect, so catch and handle exceptions here
        (new \MyCustomExceptionHandler)->handleException($exception);
    }
};

$maxRequests = (int)($_SERVER['MAX_REQUESTS'] ?? 0);
for ($nbRequests = 0; !$maxRequests || $nbRequests < $maxRequests; ++$nbRequests) {
    $keepRunning = \frankenphp_handle_request($handler);

    // Do something after sending the HTTP response
    $myApp->terminate();

    // Call the garbage collector to reduce the chances of it being triggered in the middle of a page generation
    gc_collect_cycles();

    if (!$keepRunning) break;
}

// Cleanup
$myApp->shutdown();
```

Then, start your app and use the `FRANKENPHP_CONFIG` environment variable to configure your worker:

```bash
docker run \
    -e FRANKENPHP_CONFIG="worker ./public/index.php" \
    -v $PWD:/app \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp \
    dunglas/frankenphp
```

By default, 2 workers per CPU are started.
You can also configure the number of workers to start:

```bash
docker run \
    -e FRANKENPHP_CONFIG="worker ./public/index.php 42" \
    -v $PWD:/app \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp \
    dunglas/frankenphp
```

### Using PSR-15

If your app speaks [PSR-15](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/) instead of superglobals, convert the request/response at the edges of the handler with [`nyholm/psr7`](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) and [`nyholm/psr7-server`](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7-server):

```console
composer require nyholm/psr7 nyholm/psr7-server psr/http-server-handler
```

```php
<?php
// public/index.php

require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory;
use Nyholm\Psr7Server\ServerRequestCreator;

$myApp = new \App\Kernel(); // implements Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface
$myApp->boot();

$psr17Factory = new Psr17Factory();
$creator = new ServerRequestCreator(
    $psr17Factory, // ServerRequestFactory
    $psr17Factory, // UriFactory
    $psr17Factory, // UploadedFileFactory
    $psr17Factory, // StreamFactory
);

$handler = static function () use ($myApp, $creator) {
    $response = $myApp->handle($creator->fromGlobals());

    http_response_code($response->getStatusCode());
    foreach ($response->getHeaders() as $name => $values) {
        foreach ($values as $value) {
            header("$name: $value", false);
        }
    }
    echo $response->getBody();
};

$maxRequests = (int)($_SERVER['MAX_REQUESTS'] ?? 0);
for ($nbRequests = 0; !$maxRequests || $nbRequests < $maxRequests; ++$nbRequests) {
    $keepRunning = \frankenphp_handle_request($handler);
    gc_collect_cycles();
    if (!$keepRunning) break;
}
```

### Restart the worker after a certain number of requests

As PHP was not originally designed for long-running processes, many libraries and legacy code still leak memory.
A workaround to using this type of code in worker mode is to restart the worker script after processing a certain number of requests:

The previous worker snippet allows configuring a maximum number of requests to handle by setting an environment variable named `MAX_REQUESTS`.

### Restart workers manually

While it's possible to restart workers [on file changes](config.md#watching-for-file-changes), it's also possible to restart all workers
gracefully via the [Caddy admin API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/api). If the admin is enabled in your
[Caddyfile](config.md#caddyfile-config), you can ping the restart endpoint with a simple POST request like this:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2019/frankenphp/workers/restart
```

### Worker failures

If a worker script crashes with a non-zero exit code, FrankenPHP will restart it with an exponential backoff strategy.
If the worker script stays up longer than the last backoff × 2,
it will not penalize the worker script and restart it again.
However, if the worker script continues to fail with a non-zero exit code in a short period of time
(for example, having a typo in a script), FrankenPHP will crash with the error: `too many consecutive failures`.

The number of consecutive failures can be configured in your [Caddyfile](config.md#caddyfile-config) with the `max_consecutive_failures` option:

```caddyfile
frankenphp {
    worker {
        # ...
        max_consecutive_failures 10
    }
}
```

### Number of threads

When the worker mode is enabled, an additional thread is required to handle the incoming requests,
so the default `num_threads` value is `1 + 2x(number of available CPUs)`.

Thus, in that mode if `num_threads` and `num` are explicitly set, `num_threads` must be strictly greater then `num`.

## Superglobals behavior

[PHP superglobals](https://www.php.net/manual/language.variables.superglobals.php) (`$_SERVER`, `$_ENV`, `$_GET`...)
behave as follows:

- before the first call to `frankenphp_handle_request()`, superglobals contain values bound to the worker script itself
- during and after the call to `frankenphp_handle_request()`, superglobals contain values generated from the processed HTTP request, each call to `frankenphp_handle_request()` changes the superglobals values

To access the superglobals of the worker script inside the callback, you must copy them and import the copy in the scope of the callback:

```php
<?php
// Copy worker's $_SERVER superglobal before the first call to frankenphp_handle_request()
$workerServer = $_SERVER;

$handler = static function () use ($workerServer) {
    var_dump($_SERVER); // Request-bound $_SERVER
    var_dump($workerServer); // $_SERVER of the worker script
};

// ...
```

Most superglobals (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_COOKIE`, `$_FILES`, `$_SERVER`, `$_REQUEST`) are automatically reset between requests.
However, **`$_ENV` is currently not reset between requests**.
This means that any modifications made to `$_ENV` during a request will persist and be visible to subsequent requests handled by the same worker thread.
Avoid storing request-specific or sensitive data in `$_ENV`.

## State persistence

Because worker mode keeps the PHP process alive between requests, the following state persists across requests:

- **Static variables**: Variables declared with `static` inside functions or methods retain their values between requests.
- **Class static properties**: Static properties on classes persist between requests.
- **Global variables**: Variables in the global scope of the worker script persist between requests.
- **In-memory caches**: Any data stored in memory (arrays, objects) outside the request handler persists.
- **Runtime engine settings**: Changes made with `ini_set()`, `stream_context_set_default()`, `date_default_timezone_set()`, `chdir()`, `stream_wrapper_register()`, `set_error_handler()` or `set_exception_handler()` stay in effect for later requests. Never store request- or user-specific values there, such as credentials in the default stream context: pass an explicit context to each call instead.

This is by design and is what makes worker mode fast. However, it requires attention to avoid unintended side effects:

```php
<?php
function getCounter(): int {
    static $count = 0;
    return ++$count; // Increments across requests!
}

$handler = static function () {
    echo getCounter(); // 1, 2, 3, ... for each request on this thread
};

while (\frankenphp_handle_request($handler)) {
    // ...
}
```

When writing worker scripts, make sure to reset any request-specific state between requests.
Frameworks like [Symfony](symfony.md) and [Laravel Octane](laravel.md) take care of resetting most state for you, but you may still need to reset your own services. With Symfony, services that hold request-specific state should implement [`Symfony\Contracts\Service\ResetInterface`](https://github.com/symfony/contracts/blob/main/Service/ResetInterface.php) so they're reset by the kernel between requests.
