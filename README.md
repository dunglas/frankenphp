# Caddy PHP


## Install

### Docker

The easiest way to get started is to use our Docker image:

```
docker build -t frankenphp .
```

### Compile fron Sources

#### Install PHP

Most distributions don't provide packages containing ZTS builds of PHP.
Because the Go HTTP server uses goroutines, a ZTS build is needed.

Start by [downloading the latest version of PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php),
then follow the instructions according to your operating system.

##### Linux

```
./configure \
    --enable-embed=static \
    --enable-zts
make -j6
make install
```

##### Mac

The instructions to build on Mac and Linux are similar.
However, on Mac, you have to use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager to install `libiconv` and `bison`.
You also need to slightly tweak the configuration.

```
brew install libiconv bison
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
./configure \
    --enable-embed=static \
    --enable-zts \
    --with-iconv=/opt/homebrew/opt/libiconv/ \
    --without-pcre-jit
make -j6
make install
```

#### Compile the Go App

```
go get -d -v ./...
go build -v
```
